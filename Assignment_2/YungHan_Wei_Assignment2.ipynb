    "Assignment 2 will cover Python's Built-in Data Types and Built-in Data Structures. The overall goal of this assignment is to ensure that you are comfortable with the syntax and commonly-used objects and structures within Python. There are 2 parts to this assignment. For the first part, you will be answering questions and solving problems within this notebook, the second part requires you to modify a `.py` file that will be run within this notebook for simplicity. Follow the steps below to ensure that you receive a passing grade:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Complete the following tasks within this notebook\n",
    "    - Modify the .py file to work as the assignment dictates\n",
    "    - When finished, convert this notebook to an HTML/PDF file\n",
    "    - Place the following items into a zip folder:\n",
    "        - Assignment.HTML or Assignment.PDF\n",
    "        - Assignment.ipynb\n",
    "        - Assignment.py\n",
    "    - Name this folder using the naming convention: FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_ASSIGNMENT2.zip\n",
    "        - For example, If your name was Jane Doe, then the zipped folder should be called JANE_DOE_ASSIGNMENT2.zip\n"
